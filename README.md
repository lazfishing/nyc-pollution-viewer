# NYC Pollution Viewer

Understanding our community pollution levels gives us insight into the air we breathe everyday.

The NYC Pollution Viewer provides five years of pollution data from the <a href='http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Subtopic.aspx?theme_code=1,4&subtopic_id=122' target="_blank">Environment and Health Data Portal</a>, for Black Carbon, Nitric Oxide and Fine Particulate Matter at the community district level.
